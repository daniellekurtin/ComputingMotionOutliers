# ComputingMotionOutliers
NOTE: this repo is under construction
This repo shows how global motion can be covaried with group-level results calculated via FSL


Steps:
1. Caclulate motion outliers per session per participant
2. Average motion outlier values per person
3. Covary the motion outliers with results

First, we calculate Motion Outlier values for the filtered_func_dat
